# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

## How to run

Run with Node.js:

```bash
node 2020/day_01/part_1.js
```

The following output should be printed:

```
★ =================== ★
‖                     ‖
‖  Output : 157059    ‖
‖  Time   : 578.3 μs  ‖
